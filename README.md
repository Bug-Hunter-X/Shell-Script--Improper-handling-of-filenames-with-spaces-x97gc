This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting when handling filenames containing spaces. The script `bug.sh` shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from how word splitting and globbing affect the loop iteration when filenames contain spaces.  The solution uses an array and proper quoting to handle filenames with spaces correctly.
